# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The Kickstarting with Excel challenge intends to allow students to demonstrate their newly obtained Excel skills while simultaneously strengthening them. Students are instructed to create a couple of technical analysis and submit a written report of said analysis and results. Not only does this challenge test technical skills, but also the ability to interpret and simplify the results for others to comprehend. This challenge is designed to reflect and prepare students for real-world scenarios.
### Background
Louise is an up and coming playwright who needs help starting a crowdfunding campaign to fund her play _Fever_; she has turned to you for help. First, you will use Excel to organize, sort, and analyze crowdfunding data to help her make informed decisions on how to successfully reach her goal and fund her play. Now that the fundraising goal is almost met, Louise would like to know how other campaigns reached their goals in relation to their respective launch dates and funding goals. Essentially, Louise wants to know how to efficiently and successfully reach her goal based on other plays. It is up to you to create a detailed analysis by utilizing the kickstarter data set to generate visualizations of campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and funding goals. Finally, you report the findings based on the analysis and visualizations to Louise.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
When determining the success outcome of a campaign in relation to its launch date, we can gather information that indicates whether or not the length of time for a campaign is correlated with success or what time of year would be best for launching a kickstarter campaign. By creating a table that tells us which campaigns had more success, failure, or cancelations, we notice trends that can help us make a well informed decision on how and when to launch a more effective campaign. To do so, I generated a pivot table for all campaigns based on launch date and filtered specifically for theater campaigns. After analyzing the kickstarter data for theater, we notice a clear trend in success rates; theater kickstarter campaigns launched in the month of May show highest levels of success outcomes, followed by June and July (respectively). We also notice that the months of May, June, July, and October had about the same numbers of failed campaigns. However, an interesting interpretation to be made is the noticeable positive correlation between successful and failed campaign outcomes based on launch date. In other words, the relation between successful and failed outcomes fluctuates at the same rate. So just because there are also high numbers of failed campaigns as in the successful months, the number of success outcomes is still significantly higher. This observation can be seen in "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date" line chart. December is the month to stay away from, because they practically have the same number of success and failed outcomes in which the success outcomes are very low. Based on this information, in order to increase her chances for a successful campaign, Louise should launch her campaign in the month of May. While May also has one of the highest numbers of failed outcomes, the success rate is significantly higher than the other months.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Looking at the outcomes based on goals is another helpful statistical analysis that can help make an informed decision to successfully achieving funding. In order to gather accurate data, I created a table that includes the goal value ranges, starting from <$1,000 to $50,000 or more, and the number of successful, failed, or canceled outcomes. From these data points, I then derived the percentage for each respective category and their goal ranges. According to our findings, based on total number of projects for every category (successful, failed, canceled), campaigns that successfully reached their funding were those with a funding goal of less than $1,000 (76%) or $1,000 to $4,999 (73%). While these ranges hold the top two success outcomes, it is more important to focus on the $1,000 to $4,999 range because this range had a significantly higher number of total projects, meaning not many campaigns have a goal of less than $1,000. As a matter of fact, of all the total number of projects, the majority of these projects fell in the $1,000 to $4,999 (73% success outcome). The "Percentage Outcomes Based on Goals" chart indicates there is a negative correlation between success and funding goal; the higher the cost the less likely goal is reached. Another way to think about this is a positive correlation between funding goal and failed campaigns. If Louise wants to launch a kickstarter campaign and successfully reach funding goal, it should be within the range, $1,000 to $4,999.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some challenges encountered during this analysis was of course finding the most efficient and effective way to create the data tables used to draw conclusions. For someone who has never had to analyze data using excel, it can be difficult to figure out how to accurately represent the data in a way that can be easily interpreted by someone else. Sometimes when dealing with a lot of data, such as the one we're dealing with, it can be a little overwhelming and knowing where to begin or what to look for specifically can be challenging. 
## Results
### Outcomes Based on Launch Date
After gathering and analyzing the data more closely, we can finally make educated and well-informed conclusions for Louise's kickstarter campaign. Based on the "Outcomes Based on Launch Date" data table and chart, which tells us how the length or time of year for a campaign launch effects success outcome, we can conclude that the best time to launch a kickstarter campaign would be Late spring to early summer with May being the best month and June and July also showing promising results This is probably because summer is a time in which most people vacation, which would mean more foot traffic for theater companies, allowing them to generate greater revenue. Similarly, another conclusion to be made is that it is not wise for Louise to launch a campaign during the month of December due to almost identical successful and failed outcomes. One reason for this is that December is a holiday heavy month, where people are perhaps more conservative with money. Another possibility for this is that not many people vacation during the holidays and if they are, it is to gather around friends and family. This means less foot traffic for theater companies and therefore decreasing their chances of gaining revenue and profits.
### Outcomes Based on Goals
According to our analysis of the outcomes based on goals, we can infer that Louise needs a maximum funding goal of $5,000. As seen form the data table and chart, this funding goal will significantly increase her chances of reaching her goal. While it may seem that other campaigns with higher funding goals also had high percentages of success outcomes, it is important to note that the number of campaigns were very few. This probably means that these campaigns with higher funding goals were probably already establishe playwrights. Perhaps for an up and coming playwright, like Louise, it would be best for her to launch a campaign with low funding goals. 
### Limitations and Possible Tables/Graphs
While we were able to make some conclusions based on the data gathered and analyzed, it is important to realize the limitations that may prevent us from making a more precise conclusion; in this case help Louise make the best decision on kickstarting her crowdfunding campaign. Some limitations that exist within this analysis is accounting for specific countries in which she wishes to debut her play. One way to account for this is by adding a country filter in the Percentage Outcomes Based on Goal chart to get a better idea on where plays are more likely to achieve their funding goal. Another possible update we can make to this analysis is the data itself. The most recent year we have information on is 2017. Updating the data set to include up to the most recent year would also provide the latest information on what kind of plays are more successful than others or if they have gained or lost popularity. Additionally, the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date tells us which months had the most successful outcomes, however, it does not tell us how long the campaigns went on for. Including a table that shows the length of a campaign would help Louise prepare her campaign accordingly.
